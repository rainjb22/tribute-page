        <h3>Mark Elliot Zuckerberg is a self-taught computer programmer and the co-founder, chair, and CEO of Meta (formerly Facebook). Originally named Facemash, Zuckerberg founded the social networking site in his Harvard University dorm room in 2004 and dropped out after his sophomore year to focus on developing Facebook. In May 2012, Facebook had its initial public offering, which raised $16 billion, making it the biggest Internet IPO in history and made Zuckerberg one of the youngest self-made billionaire in history.</h3>
